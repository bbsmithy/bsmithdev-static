#### Experience:


##### Software Engineer @ Flipdish - September 2019 to Present
I currently work on the frontend team for Flipdish, who offer a B2B online ordering system for restaurants and takeaways.
I work on the self serivce portal with React.js and Redux for Flipdish's customers to manage their online restaurant.


##### React.js Developer (Contract) @ Clearstream - March 2019 to September 2019
After working at Cartrawler for nearly 2 years I decided to move to Cork city to work on Clearstream's Digitization project as a contract React.js developer. I worked on the frontend review dashboard for Clearstream's digitisation platform using React.js and Redux. The digitisation platform aims to digitise unstructured data about trades that Clearstream receives from various sources such as emails, faxes and partner FTP/Websites and feed Clearstream's backend systems. I worked closely with the backend team who built out a microservices architecture to process PDF resources and extract trade data using machine learning and template data extraction. I then decided to look for more permanent work in Dublin.

##### Software Engineer @ Cartrawler - August 2017 to March 2019
I was accepted onto the Fast track to IT program with Accenture The Dock as my sponsor company. There I spent 3 months on a **C#** course run in DDLETB Tallaght Training Centre with FIT. I was then offered a job by Cartrawler's CTO at the time Bobby Healy, who was looking for young developers to join Cartrawler's new mobile development team. I spent a year and a few months working on Cartrawler's on-demand taxi mobile application (Cabforce On-Demand) with **React Native and Redux**. It has now been released with Emirates (Emirates Skywards Cabforce). I worked  mainly on developing the on-demand **Android SDK** so clients could integrate our  taxi app into their Android app. This involved native Android development (Java)  and some interesting work to communicate across the React Native bridge between Javascript and Java. I then moved on to Cartrawler's frontend web platform with **Javascript, HTML5 and CSS3 and the Java Play framework**. Some of Cartrawler's clients websites  I’ve worked on include Emirates, Ryanair, Easycar and Hawaiian Air.

#####  Part-time CTO @ Sweep - April 2018 to April 2019
I worked on car buy and sell mobile app in my spare time called Sweep for a year with a friend of mine who is CPO at another start up in Dublin. I developed an iOS and Android app using **React Native and Redux**, a secure backend using  **Node.js/Express.js with a MongoDB database** running on **AWS infrastructure**, an **image compression AWS Lambda function** written in **Python** and an web scraper written with **Node.js** to synchronise our backend with our potential partner’s websites. The project has since fallen thorugh and I've learn valuable lessons about how important it is to choose carfully who you work with and also carfully decide what projects to work on.

##### Co-Founder @ CS Software - Feb 2015 to April 2018
After starting my hurley making business I found it hard to find cost effective web development services, I decided that there was a gap in the market for low cost web development services. So I started a business called Dundrum Web Design with a friend of mine from school. Over the next few years we designed and developed web applications part-time for Irish SMEs using **JavaScript, ReactJS, Firebase**. We soon changed the name to CS Software. We initially started selling web design services to businesses in our local area. Our biggest job was a website for Dominick Comerford Architects but after that we decided we wanted more challenging work and moved on to building web applications. I then worked on a web application (for a local gym
owner) called ineedatrainer which was to match people across Dublin with personal trainers. It had a Firebase backend and was initially built with vanilla Javascript and HTML5 on the frontend. I also built a web app with an image archive management
system for my old school St.Benildus College. I used React.js on the frontend and **Node.js/Firebase** on backend **[https://benildus-college.firebaseapp.com/](https://benildus-college.firebaseapp.com/)** .

##### Founder/Hurley Maker @ Smith Hurleys - March 2014 to Feb 2015
I started Smith Hurleys when I was in secondary school as there were no hurley makers on the Southside of Dublin. I had been doing woodwork and really enjoyed it so I set about learning how to make hurls and from there I launched a business. I started selling my hurls to friends on my team and in school. But soon found the consistency of my hurls was not good enough to compete with hurls from down the country. In hindsight I should have spent more time improving my hurling making skills and perfecting the craft before trying to sell my hurls. While I was setting up my business I built a website to sell my hurls, this was my first introduction into web development and the world of software.
